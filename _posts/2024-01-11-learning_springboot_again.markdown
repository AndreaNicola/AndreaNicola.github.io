Hi everyone! I've started a new job and I'm learning Springboot again. I'm going to use this blog to write down what I
learn and to share it with you.

## What is Springboot?

Springboot is a framework that allows you to create web applications in Java. It is based on the Spring framework and
allows you to create applications with minimal configuration.

## My Java Background

I have been working with Java for a long time. I started with Java 1.4 and I have been working with Java 8 for a long
time. I've been working with Java until July 2021, when I started working with Go.

### Why am I learning Springboot again?

In two years Springboot release a new version, Springboot 3.0. I want to learn the new features and how to use them and
a lot of things i was using in the past have been deprecated.

### What I'm going to do

I will create simple application to solve common problems i will find in my work. I will use this blog to write down
what I learn and to share it with you.

To do list:

- simple CRUD
- authentication with JWT, Keycloak and Spring Security
- use of Spring Data

Stay tuned!
